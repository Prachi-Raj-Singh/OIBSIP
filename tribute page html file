Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced."</p>

			<li>Narendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home One day Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare,Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. He went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess.Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.In 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore.Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days.</li>
